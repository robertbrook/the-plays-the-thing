The fairest in all Syria,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-23" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 23.">
I tell you what mine authors say:
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-24" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 24.">
This king unto him took a fere,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-25" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 25.">
Who died and left a female heir,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-26" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 26.">
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-27" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 27.">
As heaven had lent her all his grace;
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-28" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 28.">
With whom the father liking took,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-29" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 29.">
And her to incest did provoke:
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-30" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 30.">
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own

The beauty of this sinful dame
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-35" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 35.">
Made many princes thither frame,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-36" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 36.">
To seek her as a bed-fellow,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-37" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 37.">
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-38" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 38.">
Which to prevent he made a law,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-39" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 39.">
To keep her still, and men in awe,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-40" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 40.">
That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-41" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 41.">
His riddle told not, lost his life:
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-42" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 42.">
So for her many a wight did die,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-43" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 43.">
As yon grim looks do testify.
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-44" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 44.">
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
</span><br>

I give, my cause who best can justify.
