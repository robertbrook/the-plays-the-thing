O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend

The brightest heaven of invention,

A kingdom for a stage, princes to act

So great an object: can this cockpit hold

The vasty fields of France? or may we cram

Within this wooden O the very casques

O, pardon! since a crooked figure may

Turning the accomplishment of many years

Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,

Admit me Chorus to this history;

Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,

We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
