For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,

<span id="4-2-32" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 32.">
To call a present court of parliament.

Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

After them! nay, before them, if we can.

Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:

Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
