The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?

I, from the orient to the drooping west,

Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.

I speak of peace, while covert enmity
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-13" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 13.">
Under the smile of safety wounds the world:

<span id="0-0-14" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 14.">
And who but Rumour, who but only I,

Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,

Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
</span><br>

And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe

<span id="0-0-19" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 19.">
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures

<span id="0-0-20" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 20.">

The still-discordant wavering multitude,

Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
</span><br>

This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns

Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-38" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 38.">
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-39" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 39.">
Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
</span><br>

Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-41" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 41.">
And not a man of them brings other news
</span><br>

Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
</span><br>

They bring smooth comforts false, worse than

true wrongs.

<span id="5-5-3" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 3.">
First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-4" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 4.">
My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-5" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 5.">
and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-6" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 6.">
for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-7" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 7.">
to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-8" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 8.">
should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-9" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 9.">
But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-10" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 10.">
known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-10">10</a>
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-11" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 11.">
in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-12" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 12.">
patience for it and to promise you a better. I
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-13" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 13.">
meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-14" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 14.">
ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-15" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 15.">
you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-16" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 16.">
I would be and here I commit my body to your
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-17" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 17.">
mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-18" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 18.">
as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-19" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 19.">
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-20" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 20.">
you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-20">20</a>
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-21" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 21.">
light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-22" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 22.">
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-23" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 23.">
and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-24" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 24.">
forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-25" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 25.">
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-26" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 26.">
was never seen before in such an assembly.
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-27" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 27.">
One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-28" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 28.">
much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-29" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 29.">
continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-30" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 30.">
you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-30">30</a>
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-31" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 31.">
any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-32" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 32.">
unless already a' be killed with your hard
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-33" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 33.">
opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-34" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 34.">
not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-35" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 35.">
too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-36" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 36.">
before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
