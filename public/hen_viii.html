Richly in two short hours. Only they

That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-16" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 16.">
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-17" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 17.">
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
</span><br>

To make that only true we now intend,

<span id="0-0-23" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 23.">
Will leave us never an understanding friend.

<span id="0-0-24" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 24.">
Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known

The first and happiest hearers of the town,

The very persons of our noble story
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-28" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 28.">
As they were living; think you see them great,

How soon this mightiness meets misery:
</span><br>

And, if you can be merry then, I'll say

A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

What should this mean?

What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
</span><br>

He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
</span><br>

I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!

O lord archbishop,
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-84" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 84.">
Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-85" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 85.">
This happy child, did I get any thing:
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-86" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 86.">
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-87" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 87.">
That when I am in heaven I shall desire
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-88" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 88.">
To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-89" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 89.">
I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-90" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 90.">
And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
  <a class="line" href="#5-4-90">90</a>
</span><br>
<span id="5-4-91" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 91.">
I have received much honour by your presence,

<span id="5-4-92" title="Act 6, Scene 5, line 92.">
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
</span><br>

Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,

She will be sick else. This day, no man think

Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
</span><br>

This little one shall make it holiday.

'Tis ten to one this play can never please
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-3" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 3.">
All that are here: some come to take their ease,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-4" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 4.">
And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-5" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 5.">
We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-6" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 6.">
They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-7" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 7.">
Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-8" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 8.">
Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-9" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 9.">
All the expected good we're like to hear
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-10" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 10.">
For this play at this time, is only in
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-10">10</a>
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-11" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 11.">
The merciful construction of good women;
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-12" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 12.">
For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-13" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 13.">
And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-14" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 14.">
All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,
</span><br>
<span id="5-5-15" title="Act 6, Scene 6, line 15.">
If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
