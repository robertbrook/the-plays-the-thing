So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,

<span id="0-0-5" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 5.">
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils

<span id="0-0-6" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 6.">
To be commenced in strands afar remote.

<span id="0-0-7" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 7.">
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;

Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,

Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,

<span id="0-0-13" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 13.">
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-14" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 14.">
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-15" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 15.">
And furious close of civil butchery
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-16" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 16.">
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-17" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 17.">
March all one way and be no more opposed
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-18" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 18.">
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-19" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 19.">
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,

<span id="0-0-20" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 20.">
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,

For our advantage on the bitter cross.

<span id="0-0-30" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 30.">

And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:

Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
</span><br>
<span id="0-0-33" title="Act 1, Scene 1, line 33.">
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

What yesternight our council did decree

In forwarding this dear expedience.

<span id="2-1-44" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 44.">
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-45" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 45.">
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-46" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 46.">
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
</span><br>

Opinion, that did help me to the crown,

Had still kept loyal to possession
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-49" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 49.">
And left me in reputeless banishment,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-50" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 50.">
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-50">50</a>
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-51" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 51.">
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-52" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 52.">
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-53" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 53.">
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-54" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 54.">
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-55" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 55.">
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-56" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 56.">
And dress'd myself in such humility
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-57" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 57.">
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-58" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 58.">
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-59" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 59.">
Even in the presence of the crowned king.
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-60" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 60.">
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-60">60</a>
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-61" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 61.">
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-62" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 62.">
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-63" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 63.">
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-64" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 64.">
And won by rareness such solemnity.
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-65" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 65.">
The skipping king, he ambled up and down
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-66" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 66.">
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-67" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 67.">
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-68" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 68.">
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-69" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 69.">
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-70" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 70.">
And gave his countenance, against his name,
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-70">70</a>
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-71" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 71.">
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-72" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 72.">
Of every beardless vain comparative,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-73" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 73.">
Grew a companion to the common streets,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-74" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 74.">
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-75" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 75.">
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-76" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 76.">
They surfeited with honey and began
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-77" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 77.">
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-78" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 78.">
More than a little is by much too much.
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-79" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 79.">
So when he had occasion to be seen,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-80" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 80.">
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-80">80</a>

<span id="2-1-81" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 81.">
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-82" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 82.">
As, sick and blunted with community,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-83" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 83.">
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-84" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 84.">
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-85" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 85.">
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-86" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 86.">
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-87" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 87.">
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-88" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 88.">
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-89" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 89.">
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-90" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 90.">
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-90">90</a>

<span id="2-1-91" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 91.">
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-92" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 92.">
With vile participation: not an eye
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-93" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 93.">
But is a-weary of thy common sight,
</span><br>
<span id="2-1-94" title="Act 3, Scene 2, line 94.">
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;

Which now doth that I would not have it do,
