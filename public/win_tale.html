O, peace, Paulina!
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-206" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 206.">
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-207" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 207.">
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-208" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 208.">
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-209" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 209.">
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-210" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 210.">
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
  <a class="line" href="#4-2-210">210</a>
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-211" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 211.">
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-212" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 212.">
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-213" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 213.">
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-214" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 214.">
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-215" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 215.">
Is richly noted and here justified
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-216" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 216.">
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-217" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 217.">
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-218" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 218.">
That e'er I put between your holy looks
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-219" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 219.">
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-220" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 220.">
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
  <a class="line" href="#4-2-220">220</a>
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-221" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 221.">
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-222" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 222.">
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-223" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 223.">
Each one demand an answer to his part
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-224" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 224.">
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
</span><br>
<span id="4-2-225" title="Act 5, Scene 3, line 225.">
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
</span><br>
